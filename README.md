# Terraform ECS Fargate

This project created VPC and subnets(both public private)

It creates an ECS cluster and launches a fargate instance of nginx container in ECS service and attaches it to ALB.

It outputs an ALB address which you can use to view your deployed nginx instance

Just make sure your local credentials are of admin, or just someone who has accessess to all the above resources.

There are some junk files incase you want to use ec2, it is a sort of starter kit.

******** EVERYTHING IS DEPLOYED ON US-WEST-2(OREGON) ********
